## Game Completion Tracker

Vercel Link: https://a4-zmedailleu-zeta.vercel.app/

This website allows a user to keep track of the video games that they've completed. Once they log in, they'll be able to input games into a form. When they do, the database will update and a table will show which games they've input. Then the user can modify or delete data in the table as they please. For this project, I used React components, React Bootstrap as the framework, MongoDB, Express, and Local Strategy to create the website.
